# tavern-under-dark-forest-blog
Idea of this project is to make basic site acting like a blog focusing on stories, this one will be made purely using markup languages and JavaScript. Later I will probably use PHP or other backend language to create sort of database to be able to sort written stories.

What it will look like?
I will stylise it on early fantasy websites, meaning bright colors and sharp edges, thus recreating feeling of nostalgia, and curiosity in younger generation.

What type of content there will be?
I will mainly focus on making fantasy content, those will be short stories I will create during breaks in between learning sessions.
Idea is to expand my own ability to write content since one of my goals is to have knowledge and skills to do copywriting work as additional income. And also expanding my imagination.
